<h1>OS and Web Application Penetration Test</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, I played the role of a penetration tester for a fictional organization named Rekall Corporation. My job was to was to find vulnerabilities that were present in Rekall's web application, linux, and windows server using offensive security skills that I learned. This project required me to capture flags and input them into a website to prove that I actually found the vulnerabilities. Throughout the project I utilized the different phases of penetration test engagements like reconnaissance, planning, exploitation, post-exploitation. During the project, I documented every vulnerability and provided mitigation reccomendations in the penetration report that you can find below.
